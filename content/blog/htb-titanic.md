So nothing particularly catches the eye right now. The Version guess also doesn't seem to show any exploitable versions. So let start with looking at the webpage

![Overview of the webpage](/images/htb-titanic/webpage.png)


So it looks like a booking system. I could now deepdive a bit more, try to look for subdomains or anything further but since it is a easy system I am trying to look at the Booking System first, because at first sight it is the only endpoint for user input.

I try to curl a request to the enpoint which is

>http://titanic.htb/book

Lets try a normal looking request and look at the response.

```
[fuzzywood] curl -X Post -d "name=marc" -d "email=test@user.net" -d "phone=12345678" -d "date=2027-01-01" -d "cabin=standard" http://titanic.htb/book

```

The server responses with a download link. Lets look at the ticket, which is a json file:

```
[fuzzywood] curl -X GET "http://titanic.htb/download?ticket=ff65997a-fa6f-489d-a2a4-e3164e86e09b.json"
{"name": "marc", "email": "test@user.net", "phone": "12345678", "date": "2027-01-01", "cabin": "standard"}
```


This looks nothing special for now. We are just getting the exact same response, as we requested.
Lets try and spice things up an try to manipulate the user input with known special characters.


```
[fuzzywood] curl -X Post -d 'name=";\marc' -d "email=test@user.net" -d "phone=12345678" -d "date=2027-01-01" -d "cabin=standard" http://titanic.htb/book
[fuzzywood] curl -X GET "http://titanic.htb/download?ticket=c046e336-20bb-45fb-8e5b-1da04b246a96.json"
{"name": "\";\\marc", "email": "test@user.net", "phone": "12345678", "date": "2027-01-01", "cabin": "standard"}
```
As we can see our input clearly get sanitized here. Lets look at the download enpoint here. It takes exactly
